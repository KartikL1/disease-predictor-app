# 🩺 Disease Symptoms Checker

A practical and impactful healthcare AI system that helps users identify possible diseases based on their symptoms. This project mimics the first step of a doctor's diagnosis using **machine learning** and **data analysis**.

---

## 🔍 What Is It?

The **Disease Symptoms Checker** allows users to input their symptoms and get:

- ✅ **Predicted possible diseases**
- ✅ **Disease descriptions**
- ✅ **Precautions/remedies**
- ✅ **Severity assessment**
- ✅ **Confidence scores for predictions**

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

> Using ML/NLP models to map user-reported symptoms to probable diseases based on historical symptom-disease relationships.

It bridges the gap between **self-diagnosis** and **professional medical help**, making early identification more accessible.
